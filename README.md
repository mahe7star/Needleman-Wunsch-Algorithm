# Needleman-Wunsch-Algorithm
The Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences. 
It was one of the first applications of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences.
In this java programe I have used Needleman-Wunsch-Algorithm for alignment of two given strings and also compare similarity between the two given strings.
